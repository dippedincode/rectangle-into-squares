# Rectangles Into Squares

This project will be the solution to a Codewars Kata - https://www.codewars.com/kata/rectangle-into-squares

It requires you to reduce a rectangle into its component squares.

I will do it in JavaScript using TDD and the Jest testing framework.

This has been a very good exercise to learn about and implement recursion.
